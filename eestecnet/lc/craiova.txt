LC Craiova is a member of the
EESTEC family since 2006 and
has organized numerous workshops
and has involved itself
heavily in the local student life.
This spring EESTEC LC Craiova
hosted a web programming workshop
based on well-known easyto-use
Python from 24th to 30th of
March 2013. Its aim was to teach
the 13 participants gathered in
our city from no more and no less
than ﬁve countries the most simple
and yet powerful scripting and
programming language out there in order to create a working cloud application.
The participants were greeted in a pure traditional Romanian style we all met and
became friends, thus predicting the good collaboration days that were to come
as well as the best parties we attended in a while.
Besides the learning part, Pythonia also meant parties in the city’s clubs and
pubs, preceded by billiards and bowling, a viewing of a selection of best all time
commercials, a beer drinking contest where the winner was awarded with, what
else, a python toy and a trip to an old well-known nearby wine cellar where we
all had the occasion to see the wine manufacturing process and got to taste the
wine obtained.
Pythonia meant the opportunity to learn Python and to meet new people and
their culture. At the end a working Twitter-like application has come to life and
new friendships were born. The big EESTEC family has added to the record
a new fruitful experience which the members that participated in and made it
possible will surely never forget and hope to live again soon.
