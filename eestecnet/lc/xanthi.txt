Observer Xanthi was founded in
2010 by two students of the Engineering
Department of Democritus
University of Thrace. The big
change came in the year of 2012
when we decided to change our
strategy in recruiting new people
to our observer. Right after the
annual presentation of EESTEC
among new students, we decided
to organize a small team building
training for all those interested in
order to motivate them and show
them a glimpse of eestec spirit! As an outcome of that ﬁrst training, we came up
with the idea of organizing our own ﬁrst event. To be able to do so, we decided
to organize a second training focused on project management, which wouldn’t
have been accomplished without the corporation of two EESTEC trainers from
LC Athens. Those two trainings created a solid foundation for our Observer on
which we managed, during the year, to build a very promising team of 30 actively
involved members and a total of more than 80 students registered on the
eestec.net platform.
With such a dynamic, and after the ofﬁcial recognition from our faculty, we
realized that it was about time for us to become an ofﬁcial member of EESTEC
family and so we decided to apply for JLC. Our application was accepted, and
now as JLC we organize our ﬁrst event in 17th – 24th of November “Rock the
Bit”, which is based on Arduino projects.
