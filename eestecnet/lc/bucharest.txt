Greetings from LC Bucharest!
We are in EESTEC for 10
year, since the Congress in
Cosenza, which was organized
between 9th and 16th April 2003.
Our mission is to help students
build their future. In order to
do that, we organize workshops
and exchanges. Our events are
based on personal and professional
development.
Our workshops are based on
electrical engineering subjects,
information technology and renewable energies.
We organize international motivational weekends at each end of the work-
shop. During that weekend, participants take part in soft skills trainings. The
trainings are about body language, team building, project management and they
are held by EESTEC trainers of our organization.
Our ﬁrst workshop was in 2003 and it became a traditional workshop. It was
called “Energy Always a Challenge” and now we are at the 4th edition.
We also organize exchanges. One of them was called ROSummer Spirit and
it was held during the summer of 2009 and it was really awesome.
LC Bucharest is very active locally. We have local events such as contests,
soft skills trainings, conferences, charitable parties. EESTEC Olympics is a wellknown
24 hour programming marathon that we organize in our university. Soft
Skills Academy is a 5 days soft skills training made for students and it has a great
success.
LC Bucharest prepares a lot its members. Each year we organize ICE (Inner
Circle of EESTEC) , 3 days training made for new members, so that they
can acquire the knowledge they need to work in our projects. We also organize
“Bootcamp”, a 3 days soft skills training for members, old and new, in order to
give them the knowledge they need for a successful professional and personal
life.
 Stay tuned for our events that we will organize soon! ;)
