EESTEC LC Novi Sad is a local
committee established in 2001. at
the conference in London. Our
association brings together students
from the Faculty of Technical
Sciences in Novi Sad with
the Department of Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science,
and Mechatronics. Since membership
in EESTEC carries the
responsibility and obligation, not
just membership "on paper", EESTEC LC Novi Sad, with over 250 members, is
one of the largest and most active local committees. We organized 14 exchanges
and 7 professional seminars so far, and hosted more than 200 colleagues from
European technical universities, while nearly 260 of our students are sent on the
road to Europe.
EESTEC LC Novi Sad in 2010. received a great honor to organize the ECM
(EESTEC Chairpersonsâ€™ Meeting), one of the most important events within the
organization. On the occasion of the Presidential Conference of electrical engineering
students we have hosted over 70 participants who were actively working
during the event to create a new development EESTEC strategy, involving numerous
projects in the coming years.
For the last six years EESTEC LC Novi Sad has extended the domain of their
activities, and become very active at the local level. With the excellent cooperation
with companies and universities, we organized four major competitions in
programming, several presentations and seminars for local students and a job
fair KONTEH 06, KONTEH 07, KONTEH08, KONTEH10, KONTEH11, KONTEH
12 and KONTEH 13.
For several years, EESTEC LC Novi Sad has a full support from the University
of Novi Sad, Faculty of Engineering, Provincial Department of Sport and
Youth, Provincial Department of Education and Culture, and most recently by the
Ministry of Youth and Sports of the Republic of Serbia.
