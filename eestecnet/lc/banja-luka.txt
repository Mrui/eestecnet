Local committee of Banja Luka
has been accepted in a full membership
on EESTEC congress in
Belgrade, in April 2004.
In June 2004 Local committee
is registered in Banja Luka
court as a non-proﬁt, student’s organization
with a headquarters on
Faculty of electrical engineering,
Patre 5 street.
Today, local committee counts
over 200 members. Year in year
out, many activities are occurring,
with the goal of popularizing stu-
dent volunteering and gather more members. By participating in the Local committee,
students of electrical engineering are gathering organizational skills which
are surely important in later professional career.
Through 10 years we helped 120 students of Electrical engineering in Banja
Luka, to participate in some of the EESTEC events.
Local committee has organized 6 international workshops, 3 students exchanges,
and hosted more then 100 students from all over the Europe.
Signiﬁcant fact is that, besides opportunity for professional development, considering
that students have 59 different destinations to visit, by participating in
workshop, students are able to represent our culture, our customs and break
possible prejudices.
In April 2012, Local committee organized ﬁrst Soft Skills Academy for 30
students of Banja Luka University. Students were able to work on development of
their personal and professional skills necessary for purchasing successful career
in their ﬁeld.
Having got great feedback considering our ﬁrst Soft Skills Academy, in April
2013 we decided to organize it again, and we are organizing it again in 2014
because apparently, students ﬁnd it very useful and interesting. EESTEC Banja
Luka’s SSA is slowly becoming a tradition, and our LC is getting recognized as
one of the most important student organisations of the city.
2014 will be a huge year for EESTEC LC Banja Luka, considering that this
year we are hosting one of EESTEC’s biggest events – the annual EESTEC
Chairperson’s Meeting.
