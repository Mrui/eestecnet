Since our event in 2012, we have
been working to make the LC
stronger locally. This year, we
have started organizing company
lectures for the students, which
is a great success (either by the
presented topics, or the free food
afterwards...). As a bonus, our
relations with companies grow
stronger and our member base
increases. We are planning an
event for summer 2014, so stay
tuned!
