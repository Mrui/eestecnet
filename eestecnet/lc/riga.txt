This year has turned out to be
a kind of waking up from winter
hibernation. We’ve been sleepy
and there was not much of a winter
in Latvia, so we’ve been a bit
depressed as well. But no worries
– as a nation we can seem
grumpy, before you get to know us
better.
We did enjoy some what
of international eestec spirit in
our Baltic Motivational Weekend
(BMW) and we want to get some
more. Although, during this year
we have been focusing on local events (new faces and fresh blood), it’s time to
wake up and time to get some wild international students here. It’s going to be –
wait for it – and see you in Riga soon!
