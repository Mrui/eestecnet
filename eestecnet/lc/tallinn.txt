EESTEC LC Tallinn joined the big
EESTEC family in 2005, growing
from the local organisation
Lapikud, but becoming totally independent
in August 2012. LC
Tallinn is mostly combined of students
studying information technology
and electrotechnics, but
we even have members from faculty
of economics. All that in
Tallinn University of Technology.
Through the years 2004-2010
we have continuously organised
our annual international event SummerCamp, which has always been a huge
success and source of motivation, both for organizers and participants. In 2008
we had the privilege of organising an even more demanding event - EESTEC
Chairpersons’ Meeting 2008, bringing together 45 representatives from all over
EESTEC. Organizing an event with such high importance in EESTEC was so
magniﬁcent for us that after this, we really got a boost up!
Most importantly, year 2012 was the highest point for us as being the Congress
Organizing Committee for EESTEC Congress 2012 along with LC Riga. Dropping
aside all extra activities for the previous year, we did our best and made it
an event to be remembered for years and told to generations ahead!
In 2013 we organized another event of high signiﬁcance - ECM 2013 - and
once again created a lot of great memories for EESTECers :)
