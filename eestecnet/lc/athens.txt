LC Athens was founded in 2004
by a handful of students in the
National Technical University of
Athens. Athens became ofÔ¨Åcially
an EESTEC Local Committee in
Congress 2005 in Madrid. During
these ten years, more than
900 members have joined our local
committee, and the number
is still increasing. At this point,
we have around 80 active members,
willing to help our LC make
a step further. Having organized
nine successful international workshops, with more than 460 participants from
all over Europe, LC Athens deserves the title of "must go" EESTEC LC. We
are, also, very active in our faculty, organizing many interesting local activities,
not only for our members, but also for the rest of the students. In this way, a
lot of students gain interest in EESTEC, and we keep on spreading around the
"EESTEC Spirit"!
