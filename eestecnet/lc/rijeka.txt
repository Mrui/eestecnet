LC Rijeka was founded in 1999
on Technical Faculty of University
of Rijeka. Until today we
have organized many student
exchanges, workshop ”Digitize
yourself”, and together with LC
Ljubljana EESTEC annual 2008
Congress. In the last couple of
years it has been usual for us
to organize two events annually.
Those are Rijeka Carnival Exchange
whitch is held during the
International Carnival in Rijeka,
usually in February, and ”RISEX”
(Rijeka Summer Exchange) which take place after the exam period in July. These
events become very popular and respected in EESTEC. We have really good
cooperation with other students organizations on our University, especially with
IEEE SB Rijeka, IAESTE Rijeka and Student union of our Faculty and University.
