LC Hamburg is located in the
most beautiful city in the world!
We have about twenty active
members. We are students of
Hamburg University of Applied
Sciences and most of us are
studying Electrical Engineering or
Computer Science.
Apart from a hard work at the
university we have regular Board-
and LC-Meetings. Our LC has orginized three international workshops so far and
our last event was in September 2013 called "DoscoTech". We are also active
at a local level and we organize some local events, trainings, local IMWs for our
new members.
At the beginning of every semester we also prepare a presentation for freshmen
and invite them to the welcome meeting to show what EESTEC is and to
give them the Ô¨Årst impression of EESTEC Spirit.
