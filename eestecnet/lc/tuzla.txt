Thanks to their dedication and hard work, the EESTEC spirit and idea has
been spread among new generations,and we have become full-ﬂedged local
committee.The ﬁrst workshop, organised by LC Tuzla, was held on 3rd to 10th
July 2007, under the name "Linux as an alternative". This is followed by "GIS &
GPS" in 2009, “IPTV-The Next Generation TV” in 2011 and "EESTEChnology" in
2013. Today EESTEC LC Tuzla counts over sixty members, and with each day,
this number is growing, alongside with EESTEC spirit.
