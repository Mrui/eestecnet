LC Munich has grown a lot over
the last years and now is proud
to look back to a successful year,
which has been 2013. On international
basis, we organized
Congress and two workshops,
one exchange. On national basis,
we organised one exkursion,
three seminars, a softskill training
for freshmen. Furthermore, we
founded our own independent association
to support EESTEC in
Munich.
In 2014, the handover from
the old members to the young
members is the most important
thing, nevertheless the team spirit
should not falter. The main local
event planned for next year is our
job fair CarEEr, a local job fair. International,
we plan to organize
Women in Engineering again together
with a second workshop
and a IMW, and an Oktoberfest
exchange.
