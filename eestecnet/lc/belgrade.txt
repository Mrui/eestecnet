LC Belgrade is a member of
the Association of Students of
Electrical Engineering Europe EESTEC
since 2000 and is currently,
with more than 200 members,
one of the largest and best
organized local committees in Europe.
During thirteen years of its
existence, over 900 students of
Electrical Engineering, University
of Belgrade, participated in professional
seminars and cultural
exchanges in cities all over Europe.
Since establishment, we organized more than 50 international and local events,
aimed at domestic and international students, to provide them with an opportunity
for personal and professional development, and encourage exploring different
cultures.
Everything we do we believe in outstanding individuals, therefore motivating
students for self- improvement and thinking differently is how we contribute to
the university community in our country. We are proud to be part of this association,
which provides young people with a kind of utopia and open them a
new perspective on life, technology, engineering, communications, travel, new
cultures, new experiences and meaning of successful projects. How we do it? It
is through organising free local projects for students at our University, like "Soft
Skills Academy" that was held for the fourth time in 2013, then we provide young
people with the opportunity to get the job in our country through organizing the
biggest student voluntarily project "JobFair - Kreiraj svoju budu cnost" which lasts
for nine years, and third local project, with tradition in our committee, is "Brand
new engineers" which gives our students insights in current engineering subjects
on scientiÔ¨Åc way with help from professors of our faculty.
We all know that international workshops and cultural exchanges are the core
of our eestec spirit, and we are always happy and willing to provide you the

best experience ever in Belgrade. What we get through volunteering in our local
committee are the soft skills, discovering ourselves and others through the work
on local and international projects, and the greatest gift of all is happiness that is
inevitable when you know that you have a great number of outstanding individuals
for friends and whichever eestec place you go you will be welcomed with a smile
and genuine hospitality.
