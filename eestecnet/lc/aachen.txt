We are one of the elder Local Committees and one of the foundation members
of EESTEC in 1986.
Our members are students of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology
at the RWTH Aachen University and of the University of Applied Sciences
Aachen. EESTEC Aachen is a working group of the EE Student Guild of the
RWTH Aachen. We have a close cooperation with the IEEE Student Branch
Aachen especially concerning one day excursions.
Annually we organize two events, the Aachen - St. Petersburg Exchange in
the summer of the year.
In December we are organizing our famous Niko-Event, where students are
joining us exploring Aachen and surrounding.
