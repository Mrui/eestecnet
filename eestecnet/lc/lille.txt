Since the congress of 2012 we
were promoted LC !
Still working with our international
school department, we’ve
sent several participants to workshops
and exchanges organized
by other LCs.
This year, more and more students
of our school are interested
in EESTEC. A good team was
created to organize our next workshop
: electROniCKs but still to
organize local events.
“ElectROCKnics” was LC Lille’s
workshop project for 2013. It has gathered EESTECers interested in signal processing
and electronics on one hand and music on the other. At the end of the
week, participants have played a concert in the campus of Lille I University.
See you soon ;)
