Local Committee Podgorica was
ofﬁcially accepted into full membership
on EESTEC Congress in
Delft, in 2000th year and it is the
only local committee in Montenegro.
It currently has about 70 members.
We are aware of the seriousness
of our future calls as well
as quality of knowledge we adopt
at our university, but we believe
that knowledge acquired by doing
something practical is a big plus
for future engineers, and it’s much
easier to acquire knowledge through fun so we try to procure that to our mem-
bers. Most of our members are active, and few of them are alumni members who
helped us a lot in organizing our events. We organized different kind of events till
now. Some events were with educational character – seminars about energetics
and telecommunications, course of web programming, yearly charity events
– charity action of collecting clothes, candies and school tools for children with
disabilities from a local school, summer exchanges, motivational weekends and
a workshop this summer.
EESTEC LC Podgorica is one of the most active student’s organization in
Montenegro and has very good cooperation with similar organizations. We are
planning to organize more projects which, we hope will be very interesting for our
and students from other colleges.
