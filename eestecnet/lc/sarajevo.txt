In the summer of 2006, a group
of young and motivated students
came together, combined their
ideas, and focused all their effort
into forming EESTEC LC
Sarajevo, and with that joined
the unique EESTEC family. No
one was surprised when the then
small LC Sarajevo grew into a
large and powerful organization
that gathers a big number of enthusiastic
students full of positive
energy, eager to meet new people
and broaden their horizons.
EESTEC Sarajevo is now a mosaic of 150 active and alumni members, and
with each new piece, it becomes more diverse. Each individual contributes with
their creativity, ideas and knowledge, making it possible for LC Sarajevo, as a
team, to achieve big things!
Our mission is to promote electrical engineering students, and to make it possible
for them to travel to major European cities in order to improve their technical
knowledge, foreign languages, but also to acquire unique values, lifelong memories,
to learn to appreciate different cultures and become richer with every friend
they make.
Thanks to our motivation and teamwork we have successfully organized many
educational, as well as fun projects, on local and international level such as:
- Our yearly JobFAIR for students and graduates of technical and technological
faculties;
- In 2012, for the ﬁrst time in Bosnia, we organized a Soft Skills Academy
for all students studying in Sarajevo. It will be organized for the second time in
2013.;
- International student exchange EESTEC Winter Olympic Games Sarajevo,
organized in 2009 & 2011;
- International workshop about ﬁlm making „eMovie Academy“, organized in2010, 2011 and 2013;
- An international event dedicated to celebrating our 5th birthday, "High 5
for LC Sarajevo", during which we hosted about 100 EESTECers from around
Europe;
- the 2nd EESTEC Trainers’ Meeting, dedicated to improving the EESTEC
Training Team;
- And many more local projects for our members such as soft skills trainings,
IT workshops, design workshops, etc.
We are committed to continuously improving our organization and keeping
the EESTEC Spirit alive!
