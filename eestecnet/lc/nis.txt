Currently, EESTEC Local Committee
Niš counts about 30 active
members who are totally committed
to maintain the EESTEC atmosphere
at the Faculty Of Electronics
in Niš, as well as the city
in general.
We, in the Local committee
Niš, believe that being a good engineer
does not only involve possessing
technical knowledge, but
rather good social skills as well. In
light of that, we devote a lot of attention to that kind of knowledge. Moreover, we
know that acquiring knowledge is nothing without having fun! That’s why we try
to combine both components equally during our events.
In last 12 months we organized "Jazz do it 2013" international event (3rd
edition in August 2013), but also 2 big local events: "IEEESTEC Student Conference"
(6th edition in November 2013) and "Smart technologies’ power for your
future" (2nd edition in February 2014). In this way we are trying to raise academical
level in EESTEC. We are looking forward to continuing all these projects and
we would be honored if you participate in our future events!
Few years ago we had generation change in our LC, now we gathered enough
new members, we raised our motivation, so we are ready for new challenges,
new tasks and new successful projects!
