Hello EESTEC’ers!
2013 was an year of different
dynamics.
The year started with some
changes on the board, some people
that were highly motivated after
doing their best in 7’th ECM
to made it possible and to solve
some problems from the past, put
all their effort in the preparation
of events to gather new members
and motivate the old ones - with
the mind focused in membership
development and retention, establishment of co-operational events or new connections
with student organizations.
It was all going great, with success spreading EESTEC, members applying
and participating in International Events, new members joining and a board that
was really committed and working.
In the beginning of summer appeared some internal problems in LC Lisbon
board, some members quitted due to personal problems and others went to another
cities to live in the second half of this year of 2013. There is here a big
lesson, without a sustainable main structure, there is no new motivated members
or old ones that could sustain and be committed in the LC. It was this last 4
active and committed members that despite some personal issues and problems
working together, worked in the second half of the year, talking with other organizations
in a way to search for a sustainable way to maintain LC Lisbon alive and
growing up. This leaded to some interesting contacts with BEST and IEEE.
It was necessary to stop, to rethink and to take some steps back. As they
say, sometimes it is better to take one step back to be able of doing two steps
forward, so you can expect the LC Lisbon to reborn from the ashes and ﬂy high
to ﬁnd you somewhere in Europe.
