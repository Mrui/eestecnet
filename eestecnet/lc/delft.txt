The Electrical Engineering Society
aims to promote the electrical
science and the interests of the
students from Delft University of
Technology in electrical engineering.
Our association was founded
in 1906, which makes it one of
the oldest LC’s around. In fact,
Delft was one of the founders of
EESTEC and we are very eager
to participate in the Chairpersons’
meeting. Last year we organised
a workshop and this year we will organize another one.
