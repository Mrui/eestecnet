Our local committee, LC East
Sarajevo, based at the Faculty
of Electrical Engineering in
East Sarajevo, bacame a part
of EESTEC in 2004. at the
Congress in Belgrade, after the
elementary conditions for establishment
were granted. The committee
had 15 members. That’s
when we earned a status of Observer.
A year after that, after we
organized the ﬁrst international
event «Jahorina Winter Exchange
2005», we were promoted to Local Committee. That was in Madrid, 2005. In following
years we organised several events and welcomed our participants at the
olympic beauty of Jahorina. The participants were taken to a tour of our Faculty’s
labs for electrical machines, electronics and computers, and they have also visited
high-voltage lab «IRCE» and hydro power-plant Bogati
´
ci. Beside that, the
guests could see the sights of East Sarajevo, and to feel the olympic spirit of
Jahorina.
