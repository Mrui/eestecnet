EESTEC LC Zurich is legally and
practically a part of the AMIV; the
students guild representing mechanical
and electrical engineering
students at the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology Zurich
(ETH Zurich). The members of
our LC are each 50
The external representative of
EESTEC LC Zurich is the chairman,
while contact with other LCs
in Europe and EESTEC International
is kept by the contact
person (CP). Depending on the
task, workgroups are formed to
take care of events and workshop.
Our chairman calls for a member
meeting at least every fortnight.
That way, there are always interesting
challenges for everybody
interested in joining EESTEC LC
Zurich!
From April 14th till 21th 2013,
our workshop "Slot Engines Xtreme"
was held in Zurich. The 20 participants
built slot cars from scratch
which then competed against
each other on a racetrack.
As our reputation mandates
us, we not only put together an in-
credibly demanding and fun academic part, also celebrated our legendary parties
every night. The weekend was spent in Altdorf, one of the most traditional small
towns in Switzerland - the second edition of our IMW .       Our local events during the past year included the second edition of the
EESTECopen, our local beer pong tournament, the fairly new "Erstigrillen" where
we invited our freshmen to a free BBQ in the beginning of the ﬁrst semester, a
training at the freshmen’s weekend and of course our two traditional events: the
EESTEC LC Zurich skiing weekend ind the Swiss mountains and the motivational
BBQ at the lake of Zurich.
All in all, another successful year!
Cheers from LC Zurich
