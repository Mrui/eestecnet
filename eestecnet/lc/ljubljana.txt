One of the founding LCs of
EESTEC, LC Ljubljana has been
active for more than 25 years.
The extremely motivated and innovative
members from Slovenia
have been setting milestones in
the progress of EESTEC since
it’s very beginning. In 1999 the
Congress organized in Ljubljana
was the ﬁrst event where participants
were put into a hotel to
sleep, up to then they would always
be hosted in the homes of
the organizers.
In 2006 the EESTEC Training system was implemented, the initiative started
by one of LC Ljubljana’s members.
