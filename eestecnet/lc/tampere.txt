Tampere has been in EESTEC
since it’s very beginning in 1986.
The ﬁrst 15 years, it was operated
by the Guild of Electrical Engineering,
Skilta. Then EESTEC
LC Tampere became an independent
club to serve Computer Science
and Electrical Engineering
students alike.
At the moment LC Tampere is
either stuck in old papers from the
archives or covered in paint and
plaster. Settling into a new storage
and club room always brings
this need to look at stuff, that wasn’t looked at in years. So while learning about
our past, we also invented ourselves new by launching new events.
