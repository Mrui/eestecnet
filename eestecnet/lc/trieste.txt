LC Trieste was ofﬁcially recognized
in 2006 at the Congress
in Soﬁja. Two students, Arlind
Doberdolani and Igor Stojic, went
to the Congress and understood
the great aim of the EESTEC family.
So they started working on establishing
a LC in their own university,
in Trieste.
It was very hard at the beginning
to ﬁnd new people, motivate
them and make them active.
Weekly meetings were organized
to discuss about the LC, in order
to let non eestec-ers know us and
our work, and eventually become
new members.
Currently we have ongoing
collaborations with several professors
and departments from University
of Trieste. LC Trieste also
collaborates in event organization
with elder brother IEEE sb Trieste
and with some other students’ as-
sociations from our University.
In May 2012 EESTEC LC Trieste became a legal association in our country.
Since then we have grown more and more: we got a bulletin board in the de-
partment of engineering; we got an ofﬁce and a mail box in the University only for
us; we involved partners such as Microsoft and Adecco by hosting several seminars
and training labs in our University; we organized software development labs
every week, to give students the opportunity to meet and share their knowledge;
we hosted two amazing EESTEC Summer Schools... We never sleep! :-P
