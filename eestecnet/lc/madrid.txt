Hola everyone!
LC Madrid is one of the com-
mittees which founded EESTEC
back in the 80s, being a former
member of the old association
which lead to the formation
of EESTEC: Eurielec. Since we
are very lazy, we have kept this
old name, Eurielec, for decades,
and it has become now part of
our identity. We are located at
the Telecommunication School of
the Technical University of Madrid
(ETSIT UPM), and so far, we are the only LC in Spain.
At local level, we work on different Electrical Engineering and Computer Sci-
ence projects, such as the organisation of Linux and open software courses or
the organisation of small workshops on electronics projects. We also work in
project about soft skills, working and travelling in Europe. Recently, we have
tended to be very involved in EESTEC at international level, from bodies to BAs
and even the Board.
If you want to meet us, donâ€™t hesitate to apply for one of our events!
