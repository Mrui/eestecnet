International Bureau is the body responsible for keeping the history and records of the

Association. It gathers reports and other data concerning all events and activities, sent by the

Local Committees or other bodies of the Association.

International Bureau is also of great importance in order to publish our History Books, which are

eventually issued in important anniversaries of the association.

Currently, the International Bureau is located in LC Madrid. Every year, a secretary is chosen to

coordinate the work and tasks of the Bureau.
