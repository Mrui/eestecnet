Trainings System in EESTEC, that was established in 2008 and continues until present, itâ€™s

one of the most important moments for our association. Each year, trainers are gathered

on "Training for Trainers" event, where they are educated on different topics. These participants

are carefully chosen after analysis of their previous experience and capabilities. First generation

of our trainers, gain their knowledge on how to conduct useful trainings from distinguished

European university professors, with references such as United Nations and UNICEF.

After the event, each of the trainers gets enough knowledge to prepare and hold effective

trainings, such as public relations and marketing, strategic planning, handover and

sustainability, leadership, project and time management and so on. Trainers are free to choose

any topic on which they have previous experience or a strong will to learn about it.

Each of EESTEC trainings lasts between one and three days and they are held during

international and local events of our Local Committees. That way, our members are becoming

even more educated and capable to efficiently run their Committees, EESTEC International

Teams and Bodies, but also their companies in the future career.

In order to provide for every visitor of this web page, better overview of trainings and trainers,

we created a "Trainers pool" where everyone can see which training topics our trainers

delivered in the past. With this pool EESTEC International confirms and stands behind EESTEC

trainers, their quality and capability for delivering trainings listed on their trainer profile page. To
