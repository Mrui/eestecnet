EESTEC Magazine Team is an International Team responsible for publishing issues of

EESTEC Magazine in every 6 months, on the occasion of EESTEC Chairpersonsâ€™ Meeting and

EESTEC Annual Congress.

It's formed by the Magazine Team Coordinator, and different groups of interested EESTECers

appointed to different tasks, such as quality control, design team or article gathering.

It's a perfect opportunity for all our members to get involved in publication activities, both for

those experienced people who want to contribute in the project or for those who want to acquire

useful skills in this field.
