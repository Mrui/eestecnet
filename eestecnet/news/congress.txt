Last April in Munich, LC Athens received the great honor of being the Congress
Organizing Committee for the second time, after four years. But this time is more
special for us, as this Congress reﬂects our great opportunity not only to gather
all EESTECers in our beautiful and historical city, but also celebrate the ten years
anniversary since the foundation of our LC. Two teams were created in order to
organize these huge events, the Congress OC and the “LC Athens- Ten years
celebration” OC, and they are working non stop all those months to make everything
perfect. Many new members got interested in the organizing, so our
EESTEC family got even bigger the last few months.
