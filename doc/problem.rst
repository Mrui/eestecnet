=========================
Definition of the Problem
=========================

The reasons for building and maintaining an online representation for our association are found in many different areas:

* Communication Efforts
* Public Relation Efforts
* Fundraising Efforts
* Archiving Efforts
* Event Management

Communication
=============
EESTEC is an *international* students' association.

The geographically dispersed nature of our association makes it difficult to communicate
international efforts effectively.

E-mails are a means of direct communication between two or more parties and are not effective
when trying to reach a broad audience. In EESTEC we deliver information to a broad audience
on a regular basis, such as:

* Event Announcements
* Activity reports of the International Teams
* Reports of the International Board
* Acceptance of new Observers

Fund Raising Efforts
====================

It is difficult for our association to gather funds on an international level, because
the products we offer on an European scale are few.

One of the products with international reach our association has to sell is Logo and Banner placement on the eestec.net domain.
The higher our monthly activity on this domain, the more valuable this product becomes.

It should be our goal to achieve as many "hits" per month as possible to maximise the attractiveness of our product.

Archiving Efforts
=================

EESTEC was founded in 1985, a time when the internet was still a thing from the future for most people.
We recorded our history in the archives of LC Delft, however that documentation is only accessible by the few people who travel there
and gain access to the records.

History repeats itself, but people forget. Therefore it is important to have long-lasting, automated archiving processes installed
so our association can learn from its past mistakes and grow from experience.

Nowadays it is in the responsibility of the International Bureau to gather and archive the history of EESTEC. However, this information is
currently stored locally on the server of LC Madrid. EESTEC should have its archives, if not moved, at least mirrored on our own server.
Should anything in the future happen that would disrupt LC Madrid technologically (Earthquake) or conceptually (Degradation) our archives
might be lost forever.

Event Management
================

The core activity of our association is organizing events for european students. Therefore eestec.net should strive to assist organizers
of events as much as possible, and event management functionality should be a priority.

Managing an event is a process involving planning, preparation, communication, execution and evaluation.

Planning
--------

The decision of a group of people to organize an event is the first step in planning.
The planning phase extends from this moment until far into the event itself, when last minute preparations are done.
Tasks in planning include:

* Food planning
* Pastime activity planning
* Arrival and departure planning
* Advertisement planning
* Evaluation planning

It is important that all members who wish to contribute to the planning phase have access to the relevant documents.

Preparation
-----------

Preparations include specific actions that need to be carried out in order to run an event.
Included are:

* Hostel reservations
* T Shirt order
* Badge order

Communication
-------------

Communication with the participants of the event, as well as within the group of organizers throughout the event is crucial
to the success of an event. It creates good atmosphere and helps people get to know each other better.
Included are:

* Event announcement
* Event advertisement
* Communication with participants before the event
* Internal communication between the organizers

Execution
---------

Live documentation during an event, especially photos can contribute much to the flair and spirit of an event.

Evaluation
----------

Evaluation and reflective learning are the best way to learn from experience. They provide the necessary information
to conclude if the goals of an event were reached, and to which extend.

Evaluation can be done online or offline, where online evaluation and feedback gathering is more
easily archived and made available for future iterations of an event.

Additionally every EESTEC event requires two reports to be written, one from the organizers and one from the participants.
These reports represent a major fraction of the content of the EESTEC magazine and the EESTEC yearbook.

Public Relation efforts
=======================

EESTEC as an association needs to be more widely recognized by companies, universities and individuals.
The eestec.net website should help spread awareness of our association internationally.
